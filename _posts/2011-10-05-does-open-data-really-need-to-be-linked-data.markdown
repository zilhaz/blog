So, what is the next wave after [Web 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) (aka Social Web)? If we ask this question to the inventor of the web [Tim Berners-Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) most probably the answer would be [Semantic Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web). The vision of Semantic Web is to transform the web into a distributed database system where all the data in the web will be interconnected and machine readable. Some Semantic Web evangelists are so optimistic about the future of Semantic Web that they are using the terms Semantic Web and Web 3.0 almost synonymously! According to Tim Berners-Lee's vision of Semantic Web, the web should have the functionality of connecting all of its data to each other as [Linked Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data) just like the hyperlinks of webpages in the present web architecture. Tim Berners-Lee is also a pioneer of [Open Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) movement. As Open Data are published in public domains, it offers the perfect playground for Semantic Web and Linked Data supporters.

In practice all the Open Data publishers do not necessarily care about publishing their data as Linked Data. However, Tim Berners-Lee led W3C recommends the Open Data and/or Government data publishers to put their data on the web as Linked Data (and it helps W3C in their progress towards Semantic Web). According to Tim Berners-Lee "The term Linked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing and connecting structured data on the web". This idea of Linked Data is also associated with Tim Berners-Lee's vision of Semantic Web.
