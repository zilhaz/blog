Like many other web wanderers, I am also an avid fan of [TED Talks](http://www.ted.com/talks){:target="_blank"}! TED website is my daily source of inspiration and food for thoughts! It has become sort of my daily ritual to check for new uploads in TED website at a certain period of the day. In TED curator [Chris Anderson's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anderson_(entrepreneur)){:target="_blank"} words ["Wonder, insight, ideas -- its time for TED!"](http://youtu.be/vDHET3aCI2U){:target="_blank"} (and YES, it exactly is!)

The title of this post is quite self-explanatory, isn't it? So, without stretching the intro too far, here are my hand picked four TED Talks that I personally find damn funny yet thought provoking and/or informative.

#### 1\. Charlie Todd: The shared experience of absurdity

#### 2\. Shawn Achor: The happy secret to better work

#### 3\. Chip Kidd: Designing books is no laughing matter. OK, it is
