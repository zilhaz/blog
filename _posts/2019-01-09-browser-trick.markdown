If you want to search something on Wikipedia, most likely these are your usual steps --

1.  Go toÂ <https://www.wikipedia.org/>Â either by typing the URL in the browser or by clicking the bookmark icon if you already have bookmarked it before.
2.  Wait for Wikipedia page to load
3.  Navigate to search bar in Wikipedia
4.  Search the keyword

Now, how about this to get the same result? In your browser, you just type a letter like w, press spacebar, type the keyword and hit ENTER! Just like this screenshot.

Let me help you to set it up in Chrome.

STEP BY STEP SETUP

Step 1: Go to "Settings" in Chrome Toolbar

Step 5: If you already searched something in Wikipedia before, at the bottom of the page you should see Wikipedia listed under "Other search engines" (in case you do not see it, you can add Wikipedia simply by clicking the "Add" button).

Click the dots icon.

... AND YOU ARE DONE!

The set up is done! Now in the Chrome browser, if you type 'w' and hit spacebar, you should be able to type the keyword you want to search in Wikipedia.

After hitting ENTER, it will take you directly to Wikipedia's search result page!

Suffice to say, here Wikipedia search is just an example. Following the same steps, you can add any website (with a search feature) that you visit frequently.

Good luck with your online productivity ðŸ˜Š
